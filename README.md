This is my first project
Here we learn about how to setup git and how to push code in git. 

## Background of the Ideal

Building a Simple Calculator in Python.

Make a Flowchart to solve the project.

Develop a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Understand Python syntax and basic concepts (variables, operators, functions).

Using GitHub as Version Control to Initialize a Git repository for the project.

## Getting-Started
So, we can start by creating new environment after make branch

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtual env and activate it
```
python -m venv venv
python -m venv env (for Windows)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
.\env\Scripts\activate(for Windows)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Installation 
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pandas
pip install jupyter
```


<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

This calculator is a handy tool that allows you to perform various mathematical operations. It supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and square root (√).

The program will enter an infinite loop, prompting you for calculations until you choose to stop. Here's a breakdown of the interaction:

**Continuation Prompt:**
After each calculation, the program will ask: "Do you want to calculate again? (Y/N):"
Enter 'Y' (uppercase or lowercase) to continue performing calculations.
Enter 'N' (uppercase or lowercase) to exit the program.

**Entering Numbers:**
When prompted to continue, the program will ask you to enter two numbers for the calculation.
Separate the numbers with a space or press Enter after each number.
The program will handle basic input validation to ensure you enter numeric values. If you provide invalid input, it will display an error message and ask you to enter the numbers again.

**Choosing an Operation:**
Once you've entered valid numbers, the program will prompt you to select the operation you want to perform:
```Please type the operation that you would like to complete (+, -, *, /, √):```
Enter the symbol for the desired operation:
- '+' for addition
- '-' for subtraction
- '*' for multiplication
- '/' for division
- '√' for square root
- 
**Viewing the Result:**

After selecting the operation, the program will perform the calculation and display the result on the screen.
Loop Continuation:

The program will then return to the continuation prompt, asking if you want to perform another calculation.
**Example Usage:**

```
Do you want to calculate again? (Y/N): Y
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Please type the operation that you would like to complete (+, -, *, /, √): +
Result: 15
Do you want to calculate again? (Y/N): Y
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 2
Please type the operation that you would like to complete (+, -, *, /, √): /
Result: 4.0
Do you want to calculate again? (Y/N): N
See you later.
